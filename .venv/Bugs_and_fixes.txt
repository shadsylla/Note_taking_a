Project:    APP that allows calls and video calls using the phone number. 
            With slight modifications.

          B.and HAD TO TURN OFF THE COMPUTER. 

3.Problems with jinga language " {%%}, block content, endblock and their order and frequency. 

4. mistake on using " len " for length on evaluating the length of the user input email. 

5.    "applic = creating_app()" has a problem that only appears on the ide terminal. 
6.    termainal: line 33, in " creating_app .... from .auth import auth. And the others have same type of flavour of bugs. 

7. Now I am unable to use the pip command. It seems to have to do with 
   path and environment. So this is a connection of computer and the instalation of python. 
   And something to do with scipts it should like this: Computerdisk/info_about_pc/file.S

8. Proposed solution is realy on others exepertise.

Objectives: 

This app should graph data easily. In a small intuitive form. 
To get there I intend to use come functions to display that. 

Right now: I am working on the data base which will be populated by the user, 
and 
the next step will be notifications triggered by time. 
The app should keep track of the happiness of users with their interactions with the app. 
A total focus on value added into their lives. 
Questions seeking to measure individuality and community are the directions emmbeded in my philosophy. 



Idea:  
Notes input taking through microphone and displayed in color and shapes made by the programmers. 
In the way of small ai. 
a. hardware issue. 
b. and software can be grok.
